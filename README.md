Q2: Discuss How you managed the state in your assignment project.


Answer:
In my project I declared the states 
in parent component.
 and used them in child components. I declared the states in "CourseContainer.jsx"  file. 
 And used them in child components like Course.jsx,CreditComponent.jsx files by sending them as props.
So thats how I managed the states in my assignment Project.
